# OpenWebUI_Visualize_Data
version: 0.0.2r1; untested update to Omar's orginal code.  Given the information in the document titled Migration Guide: Open WebUI 0.4 to 0.5. 
Note: If you have trouble running this function, open a python cli and try doing the imports in the first few lines.  If the imports error out then use pip to install the modules. 

There are 2 different json files.  If one does not import correctly into your OpenWebUi tools menu, then try the other one.  

There are no gaurantees this works as I am still testing.
